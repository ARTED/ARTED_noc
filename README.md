# ARTED_noc: Ab-initio Real-Time Electron Dynamics Simulator (non-othogonal coordinate version)

ARTED (Ab-initio Real-Time Electron Dynamics simulator) is an open-source
computer codes for first-principles calculations of electron dynamics and
light-matter interactions [1]. It is based on time-dependent density functional theory
solving time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation in real time using pseudopotentials
and real-space grid representation.

ARTED has been developed by ARTED developers with support from
Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba.
